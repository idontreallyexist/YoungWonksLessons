Please make sure you have the following modules downloaded on VS Code before running:
Numpy
Pandas
Streamlit

After unzipping the folder, open the entire unzipped folder with VS code

LunarVisualizer.py includes the actual application
DataFormatter.py generates the Nobile1.csv file from the files in the data folder

As LunarVisualizer.py uses streamlit, it cannot be run by pressing the run button
Instead, the project must be run directly from the terminal using the following command:
-m streamlit run LunarVisualizer.py

If the above command doesn't work, try typing the file path to python, then running the command
Example: C:/Users/charl/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe -m streamlit run LunarVisualizer.py
